                                    Enternal Kingdoms is a real-time strategy (RTS) game that integrates blockchain
                                    technology, allowing players to engage in activities such as building kingdoms,
                                    managing resources, and participating in PvP and PvE battles. Operating on the
                                    Ethereum platform, the game enables players to own in-game assets as NFTs, including
                                    land and unique items. These assets can be bought, sold, traded, or leased on the
                                    marketplace, offering real earning potential.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Enternal Kingdoms combines classic strategic elements with blockchain innovation,
                                    providing players with a unique experience where they can not only manage and expand
                                    their kingdoms but also leverage the economic value of their digital assets. The
                                    game creates opportunities for building alliances, defending territories, and
                                    expanding influence, while harnessing the potential of NFTs to generate tangible
                                    value from in-game activities.

                                                    Cleopatra is commonly known as the Queen of Egypt. Born in 69 BC,
                                                    she was one of the monarchs of the Ptolemaic dynasty after the
                                                    conquest of Egypt by Alexander the Great, and the last female
                                                    pharaoh of the dynasty. She was unusually talented, beautiful,
                                                    clever, and witty, and a skilled tactician. She harbored many
                                                    ambitions and had quite a dramatic life. In particular, she was
                                                    involved in the political maelstrom at the end of the Roman
                                                    Republic, and was closely involved with Caesar and Mark Antony. The
                                                    stories and rumors than accompanied her made her a well-known figure
                                                    in works of literature and art. The Romans hated her because she had
                                                    almost made Rome a region of Egypt; the Egyptians hailed her as a
                                                    courageous warrior because she had won 22 years of peace for a weak
                                                    Egypt. In 30 BC, when Octavian attacked Egypt, Cleopatra committed
                                                    suicide. Egypt was incorporated into Rome and the civilization of
                                                    Ancient Egypt came to an end.

                                                    Rurik reigned during 862-879, after founding the Russian Rurik
                                                    dynasty. He was also the Grand Duke of Novgorod, and came from the
                                                    Norse in the northern part of the Jutland Peninsula. Rurik, a chief
                                                    of the Varangians, was fierce and warlike. From a young age, he set
                                                    out on a life of adventure with his band of warriors. He established
                                                    Ladoga Castle under his jurisdiction on the shores of Lake Ladoga,
                                                    200 miles from the city of Novgorod. According to the Russian
                                                    historical work "Chronicle of the Past", after the expulsion of the
                                                    Rus people, the Eastern Slavic tribes were so exhausted from
                                                    fighting each other that in 862, they agreed to go to Northern
                                                    Europe to invite the Rus back. The ambassador crossed the sea to
                                                    Scandinavia and asked the Varangians to come and rule over them,
                                                    restoring peace and order to the Eastern Slavs. So the Rus elected
                                                    three brothers to lead them — the eldest Rurik, the middle brother
                                                    Sineus, and the youngest Truvor. The brothers went to Novgorod, Belo
                                                    Ozero, and Izborsk, where they established their respective
                                                    territories and ruled over them. However, the deaths of Sineus and
                                                    Truvor soon followed, and the power was concentrated in Rurik's
                                                    hands, beginning the Rurik dynasty that would last for 700 years and
                                                    gave rise to the country of Russia.

                                                    Mehmed II was the 7th monarch of the Ottoman Empire, but many
                                                    historians claim he was the empire's true founder. He had a famous
                                                    nickname, Fatih, meaning “conqueror,” because at the age of 21 he
                                                    was already able to command an army that captured Constantinople and
                                                    destroyed the Byzantine Empire, fulfilling the long-standing desire
                                                    of generations of sultans. Later, he invaded the Balkan hinterlands
                                                    of the west and fought against the Ak Koyunlu dynasty in the east,
                                                    laying a solid foundation for the Ottoman Empire's centuries of
                                                    rule. In addition to being a great military leader, Mehmed II was
                                                    also an outstanding ruler. He implemented a series of measures that
                                                    effectively strengthened the rule of the Ottoman Empire, especially
                                                    his policies of religious and cultural tolerance, which were rare in
                                                    those times. These measures led to the stabilization of the Ottoman
                                                    Empire, and to significant economic and cultural development.

                                                    Osman I founded the Ottoman Empire. He was the son of Ertuğrul and
                                                    was born in Söğüt, in northern Asia Minor. He was a devout believer,
                                                    abiding by his religious practices and living a frugal life. Osman
                                                    was a brilliant military strategist and organizer. Under his
                                                    leadership, the Ottoman Empire grew almost non-stop. Osman captured
                                                    many Byzantine cities, earning the title of “Bey” (“Chief”). After
                                                    capturing the city that he renamed Kara Hissar, he moved his capital
                                                    there as a stronghold for further advancement. Then, Osman I set his
                                                    sights on Bursa, the last stronghold of the Byzantine Empire in Asia
                                                    Minor. Once Bursa had been taken, the Sea of Marmara, which led to
                                                    Europe, lay wide open. The siege was hard fought, going back and
                                                    forth for 9 years. Right when he was on the verge of breaking into
                                                    the city, Osman's life came to an end. He gave his name to the
                                                    Ottoman Empire, which lasted over 600 years. This vast empire
                                                    spanned the three continents of Asia, Africa, and Europe, and was
                                                    one of the most powerful and prosperous empires in the world.

                                                    Al-Mansur Qalawun (1222 - 1290) was the seventh Bahri Mamluk sultan
                                                    to rule Egypt. He was sold as a slave for a thousand dinars when he
                                                    was 30 years old. He barely spoke Arabic, but soon joined the Mamluk
                                                    and befriended Baibars. Qalawun and Baibars convicted Mamluk's
                                                    second sultan, who fled to Damascus. Qalawun and Baibars established
                                                    a deep friendship during this period. Qalawun followed Baibars and
                                                    together founded the new Mamluk dynasty.<br />
                                                    After Baibar's death, the dynasty was engulfed in turmoil until
                                                    Baibar's seven-year-old son finally took the throne. Frequent
                                                    scuffles and young leaders caused further unrest in the country.
                                                    Qalawun realized what needed to be done. He exiled Baibar's young
                                                    son and ascended the throne as the new Sultan. During his reign, he
                                                    stopped the Mongolians from setting foot in Egypt and defeated the
                                                    Crusaders. The dynasty stabilized and Mamluk reputation spread far
                                                    and wide.<br />
                                                    He lived a long life, dying at the age of 70 due to an illness. His
                                                    life's merits were worthy of the people under his rule and his two
                                                    sons succeeded the throne. The dynasty entered a prosperous golden
                                                    age under Qalawun and his sons' rule.

                                                    Harun al-Rashid is the most famous Caliph of the Abbasid dynasty in
                                                    the Arab Empire. He became famous in the West for his Alliance with
                                                    Charlemagne, King of the Franks, as well as for his many anecdotes,
                                                    vividly illustrated in the world-famous book One Thousand and One
                                                    Nights. He was well educated by the court in matters of religion and
                                                    culture, and was well versed in the teachings and laws of Islam.
                                                    With his deep love for philosophy, poetry, and music, he was a
                                                    master of both sword and pen. He went on two campaigns at the ages
                                                    of 15 and 17, defeating Byzantium and commanding a yearly tribute.
                                                    This earned him a widespread reputation, and his father awarded him
                                                    the title of Rashid, meaning “Orthodox” or “Rightly-Guided”. In 786,
                                                    he succeeded the Caliph due to the sudden death of his brother.
                                                    During the 23 years of his reign, the country was strong,
                                                    economically prosperous, and culturally advanced. The capital,
                                                    Baghdad, became the political, economic, and cultural center of the
                                                    Arab Empire, and a gathering-place for scholars. During his reign,
                                                    he was very supportive of academia and generous toward his subjects.
                                                    He was also very farsighted in diplomacy and world politics, which
                                                    resulted in the Abbasid dynasty's victory over Byzantium and the
                                                    alliance with Charlemagne. The Arabs' ability to absorb the best of
                                                    Greek, Persian, Indian, and other foreign cultures in a short period
                                                    of time to create an encompassing yet distinctive Arab culture was
                                                    clearly related to Harun's enthusiastic support and active
                                                    encouragement of literature and the arts. Harun's rule heralded a
                                                    golden age for the Abbasid dynasty. But his mistakes in handling
                                                    internal affairs laid the roots of future division. He divided the
                                                    country evenly between his two sons. After his death, civil war
                                                    broke out immediately.

                                                    and Siberian khanates, defeated the Crimean khanate, and pushed
                                                    Russian territory further east. The Mongols were no longer a threat
                                                    after these efforts. In some campaigns, he went into battle and
                                                    brought northern Caucasia back under Russian control. During his
                                                    reign, "Tsar" became the official title of the Russian monarch. He
                                                    was the best orator in Moscow, with an excellent command of the
                                                    Russian language, and was one of Russia's most distinguished
                                                    linguists and writers. Although most of his work has been lost, it's
                                                    clear from his surviving work that he had extraordinary wordplay
                                                    skills and a biting wit. As a result of his early accession, his
                                                    mother temporarily acted as regent, and various groups began to vie
                                                    for power. The constant conflict and assassinations had a profound
                                                    impact on him as he grew up. He was strong-willed and ruthless from
                                                    a young age, and harshly repressed the nobility. At the age of 13,
                                                    he ordered the execution of a rival lord, and he once beat his
                                                    eldest son to death with a cane in a fit of rage. He was born during
                                                    a thunderstorm, and some think he got the title Ivan Grozny, “Ivan
                                                    the Terrible” or “Ivan the Thunderous” because of this. However, the
                                                    epithet is more likely due to his chilling actions.

                                                    Abu al-Abbas as-Saffah was the founder of the Abbasid dynasty, and
                                                    the first Caliph of the Abbasids (750-754). In June of 747, as the
                                                    declining Umayyad dynasty came to and end, he raised the banner of
                                                    rebellion against the dynasty. Many dissatisfied groups supported
                                                    him, including the Iranians and the people of Khurasan. In early
                                                    750, the Abbasids met Marwan II's army on the Zab River, a tributary
                                                    of the Tigris. The Abbasid army was victorious, and the battle
                                                    hastened the demise of the Umayyad Dynasty, which was complete after
                                                    Damascus surrendered in April 750. With Kufa as his capital and Iraq
                                                    as the center of his empire, As-Saffah became Caliph and established
                                                    the Abbasid dynasty. After taking power, As-Saffah executed nearly
                                                    every member of the Umayyad family. In his inaugural speech in Kufa,
                                                    he called himself “Saffah”, which means either “shedder of blood” or
                                                    “generous, merciful person”.

                                                    Al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf was born in 661 to the Banu Thaqif tribe in
                                                    Ta'if. He was physically ugly, short in stature, and one-eyed, but
                                                    he was intelligent and eloquent. He was despised by his classmates
                                                    because of his disability, and developed a cruel and withdrawn
                                                    personality. As an adult, his talents remained unrecognized.
                                                    Aggrieved by this, he became increasingly ruthless and violent,
                                                    often flogging soldiers and causing discontent among his
                                                    subordinates. Hearing this, the Caliph Abd al-Malik summoned him
                                                    and, appreciating his abilities, made him an officer in the campaign
                                                    against Basra. Later, his true talents were revealed. In 691,
                                                    Al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf took over as commander of the Mecca expedition,
                                                    first going to his hometown of Ta'if, then to Yathrib (modern-day
                                                    Medina) to summon the scattered soldiers and convert them into his
                                                    own army. Once the fighting began, he laid siege to Mecca for six
                                                    months and successfully conquered the city. He was rewarded by Abd
                                                    al-Malik with the position of governor of the Arabian Peninsula and
                                                    Iraq. During his tenure, his administration was brutal and bloody,
                                                    and he was known as the Iron Fist because of his repressive policies
                                                    and subjugation of the Mawali (new converts to Islam).

                                                    Ramesses II, son of Pharaoh Seti I, was Pharaoh during the 19th
                                                    dynasty of ancient Egypt. An outstanding politician, strategist,
                                                    writer, and poet, his rule was the last golden era of the new
                                                    kingdom of Egypt. During his reign, Ramesses II carried out a series
                                                    of expeditions and clashed with the Hittite Empire, a powerful force
                                                    at the time. After the death of the Hittite king, the new king
                                                    entered into a contract with Egypt to form a military alliance. This
                                                    is arguably the first famous international alliance in history. Out
                                                    of concern for the Hittites' military power, Ramesses II ordered a
                                                    new city to be built on the northeastern Nile Delta as his capital
                                                    and named it Per-Ramesses (meaning “Home of Ramesses”). Ramesses II
                                                    created many works for his famous queen and ordered sculptures to be
                                                    built in her honor. Ramesses II was one of Egypt's most famous
                                                    pharaohs, and his enthusiasm for huge civil works left his mark all
                                                    over Egypt. The reign of Ramesses II gave Egypt a radiance never
                                                    seen before. He passed away at the age of 96, taking with him the
                                                    last afterglow of his shining light.

                                                    Alp Arslan, whose real name was Muhammad bin Dawud Chaghri, was the
                                                    second Sultan of the Seljuk Empire. During his reign, Alp Arslan won
                                                    many battles against Egypt's Fatimid dynasty and the Eastern Roman
                                                    Empire, which enabled him to expand his empire's territory. Later
                                                    generations admired his uncommon military prowess and honored him
                                                    with the Turkish title "Alp Arslan", meaning “Heroic Lion”. His
                                                    political activities were founded on the great ideals of the three
                                                    monarchs of Seljuk, and he made several attacks on Byzantium,
                                                    Georgia, and Armenia. In 1064, he led an attack on the Byzantine
                                                    Empire, defeating and capturing the Byzantine Emperor Romanus IV
                                                    thanks to his excellent strategy. This was the decisive battle of
                                                    the Byzantine-Seljuk wars, in which Alp Arslan truly showed his
                                                    talents. But his aim was not to immediately annihilate the Byzantine
                                                    Empire, just to revise its borders. He generously released the
                                                    captured emperor so that he could demand more tributes. On November
                                                    25, 1072, at the age of 43, Alp Arslan was unexpectedly stabbed to
                                                    death by a prisoner during a hunting trip. Conquest was his greatest
                                                    pleasure in life. He had no interest in the practicalities of
                                                    governance, entrusting them to his ministers along with the
                                                    administration of the empire.

                                                    of the Ayyubid dynasty in Egypt. He is known as a national hero for
                                                    his outstanding performance in many battles. Saladin's most
                                                    outstanding achievement was the capture of Jerusalem, which brought
                                                    a dramatic turnaround in the struggle for the land. He also
                                                    consolidated Syria, Egypt, and vast areas of West Asia under the
                                                    rule of a unified regime. He was widely praised for his generosity,
                                                    so he left behind only 1 dinar and 47 dirhams when he died. On his
                                                    deathbed, Saladin exhorted his eldest son, Malik al-Afdal, to be
                                                    sensitive to the situation of the people and care for their plight.
                                                    On March 3rd, 1193, Saladin died in Damascus at the age of 55. After
                                                    his death, people often visited his mausoleum to pay their respects.

                                                    Hatshepsut reigned from 1479-1458 BC, and was Queen of the 18th
                                                    dynasty of Ancient Egypt. She was the only child of Thutmose I and
                                                    his queen, and became Pharaoh, founding a prosperous era for Ancient
                                                    Egypt. She grew up smart, bold, strong, and skilled in the art of
                                                    politics. Priding herself on being the only legitimate heir to the
                                                    pharaoh, she dreamed of one day ruling a strong Egypt. She married
                                                    her half-brother Thutmose II, whose mother was a royal concubine.
                                                    Thutmose II suffered from fragile health and had no desire to rule.
                                                    Soon after he succeeded to the throne, the power fell to Hatshepsut.
                                                    A few years later, Thutmose II fell ill and died. Hatshepsut
                                                    arranged for Thutmose III to marry her daughter and ascend to the
                                                    throne. In her capacity as regent, she retained full authority over
                                                    the affairs of state. Her administration put an end to Egypt's wars
                                                    abroad, thus destabilizing Egyptian rule in Syria and Palestine.
                                                    However, her domination over Egypt's trade and commerce with its
                                                    neighbors also made Egypt prosperous. When Thutmose III grew up,
                                                    Hatshepsut exiled him to a remote place. Claiming to be the daughter
                                                    of the sun god Amun, she ascended to the throne. A significant
                                                    change occurred in the 22nd year of Hatshepsut's reign. Thutmose III
                                                    suddenly returned from exile and Hatshepsut disappeared. Evidence
                                                    seems to suggest that this was connected to the appointment of
                                                    Thutmose III as head of the army. During the independent reign of
                                                    Thutmose III, words and images referring to Queen Hatshepsut were
                                                    chiseled off most stone monuments. Hatshepsut I has since become one
                                                    of the most mysterious Egyptian pharaohs. She was also the first
                                                    historically confirmed female ruler in the world.

                                        Enternal Kingdoms is a real-time strategy (RTS) game that integrates blockchain
                                        technology, allowing players to engage in activities such as building kingdoms,
                                        managing resources, and participating in PvP and PvE battles. Operating on the
                                        Ethereum platform, the game enables players to own in-game assets as NFTs,
                                        including land and unique items. These assets can be bought, sold, traded, or
                                        leased on the marketplace, offering real earning potential.

                                        If you are a new or experienced player in Eternal Kingdoms, you need to
                                        understand how to upgrade your army. You should upgrade your army but not
                                        immediately. Runes, kingdom buffs, your resources, completion speed, events, and
                                        other factors all affect army upgrades in Eternal Kingdoms.
